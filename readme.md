## **From Zero to GenAI: A Hands-On Learning Journey**  

### 🚀 **Project Aim**  
The **From-Zero-to-GenAI** project is a structured, hands-on guide to mastering **Generative AI (GenAI)** from scratch. Whether you're a complete beginner or a developer looking to dive deep, this repository provides a step-by-step approach with real-world coding exercises, structured explanations, and Hugging Face deployments.  

### 🤖 **Why This Project?**  
Learning AI can be overwhelming. We simplify the process with:  
✔ **Practical Code Examples** – Each topic comes with a fully functional Python script.  
✔ **Two-Level Explanations** – One for a **10-year-old** and another for a **25-year-old** to make concepts easy to grasp.  
✔ **Hands-on Exercises** – Small tasks to reinforce learning.  
✔ **Live Deployments** – Run the AI models **directly on Hugging Face Spaces** without setup hassles.

## 📂 **Project Structure**  

Each topic is organized into a separate folder:  

```
From-Zero-to-GenAI/
│── 01_LLM_Basics/
│   ├── README.md  # Detailed explanation of concepts
│   ├── code/      # Python scripts for local execution
│   ├── deployment/ # Hugging Face deployment scripts
│   ├── screenshots/  # Images & videos for documentation
│   ├── references.md  # Additional learning resources
│── 02_RAG/
│── 03_... (More topics coming)
│
|
│── README.md  # This main file
```

Each topic folder contains:  
📌 **README.md** – Explains the concept in simple terms.  
📌 **code/** – The main Python script for local execution.  
📌 **deployment/** – Scripts to deploy the AI model on Hugging Face.  
📌 **references.md** – Helpful resources & links.
