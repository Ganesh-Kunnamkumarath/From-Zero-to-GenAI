Generative AI, or generative artificial intelligence, is a type of AI that can create new content like text, images, videos, and music. It can also learn human language, art, chemistry, and more. 

How does generative AI work?
    Uses large AI models called foundation models 
    Uses deep learning models, which are algorithms that simulate the human brain's learning and decision-making processes 
    Can learn from data and generate new data instances 
    Can be adapted for targeted use cases with minimal training 


Examples of generative AI
    Creating a short story based on a specific author's style 
    Generating a realistic image of a person who doesn't exist 
    Composing a symphony in the style of a famous composer 
    Creating a video clip from a simple textual description 
    Improving plant nutrient management, reducing fertilizer waste, and improving crop health 
    Applications of generative AI Virtual assistance, Customer support, Natural language understanding, Automating the manual process of writing content, and Reducing the effort of responding to emails.
