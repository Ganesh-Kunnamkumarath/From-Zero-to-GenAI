## **üîπ Concept Breakdown **

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **`return_tensors="pt"`**

- This tells the tokenizer to return the output **as a PyTorch tensor** (`"pt"` stands for PyTorch).
- PyTorch tensors are used because the model expects **numerical input** (not plain text).
- Example: `"Hello"` ‚Üí `[21938, 628]` (converted into token IDs in tensor format).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **`padding=True`**

- Chatbots process text in **fixed-size chunks** (e.g., 128 tokens per input).
- Some inputs are **shorter**, so padding fills them up to the required size.
- Example:
  ```
  Input 1: "Hi" ‚Üí [21938] ‚Üí [21938, 0, 0, 0] (Padded with 0s)
  Input 2: "Hello, how are you?" ‚Üí [21938, 374, 57, 89]
  ```
- This ensures all inputs have **the same length**, making batch processing efficient.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **`truncation=True`**

- If the user types a very **long input**, it gets **cut off** at the model‚Äôs maximum length.
- Example:
  ```
  Input: "This is a very long text that exceeds the limit..."
  Truncated: "This is a very long text..."
  ```
- This prevents errors and keeps responses **fast & efficient**.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **`pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id`**

- The model **doesn‚Äôt know where input ends** unless we tell it.
- `eos_token_id` (End-of-Sequence Token) marks the **end of a sentence**, preventing repetition.
- Example:
  ```
  Normal Output: "Hello, how are you? Hello, how are you? Hello, how..."
  With `eos_token_id`: "Hello, how are you?"
  ```
- This avoids infinite loops or strange outputs.

Generate image

response = openai.images.generate(
n=3, # Generates 3 images
)
This will return 3 different images, and you can pick the best one.

‚úÖ DALL¬∑E 2 (Older model)
"256x256" ‚Üí Small, fast generation
"512x512" ‚Üí Medium resolution
"1024x1024" ‚Üí High resolution
‚úÖ DALL¬∑E 3 (Better quality, newer model)
"1024x1024" ‚Üí Square image
"1792x1024" ‚Üí Wide landscape
"1024x1792" ‚Üí Tall portrait

Generate voice

with open(output_file, "wb") as f:
f.write(response.content)

open(output_file, "wb") opens a file for writing in binary mode ("wb").
f.write(response.content) writes the generated audio data into the file.

"w" (write mode) is for text files.
"wb" (write binary mode) is for binary files like images, audio, and videos.

### Where is OPENAI API Key set?

The openai library automatically looks for the API key in these locations (in order of priority):

Explicitly set in code: openai.api_key = "your-api-key-here"
Environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY
Configuration files (if manually implemented using dotenv)
